### Third-Party Service Requirements

### Reverse Proxy Support

Playlist Lab works seamlessly behind reverse proxies (Nginx, Apache, Caddy, etc.). 

**Configuration:**
Set `PUBLIC_URL` in your `.env` file to your public domain:
```env
PUBLIC_URL=https://playlist-lab.yourdomain.com
```

**Example Nginx Configuration:**
```nginx
location / {
  proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

This ensures OAuth callbacks and other features work correctly with your reverse proxy setup.

### Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/playlist-lab.git
